### Abstract
This project addresses the challenge of identifying optimal regions for solarization while considering the availability of alternative energy resources. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the system analyzes factors such as solar irradiance, geographical features, and energy resource data to prioritize regions suitable for solar energy development. By integrating information on alternative energy resources, the system offers a comprehensive assessment of energy potential in each region, facilitating informed decision-making for sustainable energy infrastructure development.
